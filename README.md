Great job pushing your code to GitHub and setting it up with jsDelivr! Now, you can easily integrate your JavaScript file into your Wix site or any other platform by using the CDN link provided by jsDelivr.

Here’s how you can proceed with embedding your JavaScript file using the jsDelivr CDN link:

### Step 1: Generate the jsDelivr CDN Link

Since your file is hosted on GitHub, you can create a jsDelivr link using the following format:

```plaintext
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/username/repository@version/path/to/file
```

For your specific file, the link would look like this:

```plaintext
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AlperAKBAS/AgGridWixEmbed@main/embeddings/ag-grid-basic.js
```

### Step 2: Integrate the CDN Link into Your HTML

You can now use this link in your HTML component within Wix or in any other application where you need to include your JavaScript file. Here’s an example of how you might include it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>AG Grid Embedding Example</title>
    <!-- Include the JS file from jsDelivr -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AlperAKBAS/AgGridWixEmbed@main/embeddings/ag-grid-basic.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>AG Grid Embedding Example</h1>
    <div id="grid-container"></div>

    <script>
      // Initialize your grid or any other functionality using the included JS file
      // Example: initialize AG Grid
      if (typeof initializeAgGrid === "function") {
        initializeAgGrid("grid-container");
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Debugging and Testing

1. **Test in Wix**: Add this HTML snippet in your Wix HTML component to test it directly on your live or staging site.
2. **Local Testing**: Use a local server (like the VS Code Live Server) to preview and debug the functionality before deploying it to your Wix site.
3. **Console Logs**: Utilize console logs and browser developer tools to ensure the JavaScript file loads correctly and functions as expected.

### Key Considerations:

- **Version Control**: Always reference a specific version or commit hash if you want to lock down your code to a particular state. For production environments, avoid using the `main` branch directly, as it may change over time.

  Example:

  ```plaintext
  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AlperAKBAS/AgGridWixEmbed@commit-hash/embeddings/ag-grid-basic.js
  ```

- **Caching**: jsDelivr caches files for performance. If you update your file, you might need to purge the cache on jsDelivr to reflect the changes immediately.

- **Security**: Ensure your JavaScript file is secure and doesn't expose sensitive data or functionality.
